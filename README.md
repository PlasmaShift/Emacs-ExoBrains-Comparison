# TODO intro &#x2013; I will write this after more of the document is done, besides being easier and at that point I would probably rewrite it anyway

# Goals


## Working on


### TODO Fix this charts remove org enhancements package from charts packages and focus on comparing and contrasting ExoBrain packages


### TODO Compare packages intelligently. ex Zetteldesk is not a ExoBrain so not in charts. org super links is for ExoBrains so in charts


### TODO Clean up document


### TODO Add more packages


### TODO Fill out package descriptions


### TODO Add unicode superscripts ยณ in charts and at bottom of charts for additional notes as needed


### TODO Count talks in EmacsConf 2022 talking about ExoBrains for use in intro. There was a lot of them


## Goals

1.  Give short 2 second descriptions to packages
2.  Compare and contrast packages
    1.  This is where "I/we?? choose one" expound on subjects that differentiate between these packages
    2.  Talk some about the philosophies and workflows some packagers encourage or were made for


## TODO Maybe Goals | Nice to have Goals &#x2013; Choose one

1.  Make multiple MVP "minimum viable product / or bare-bones" emacs configs with some demo ExoBrains so you can get a feel for the workflow
    -   Might be a separate project but intended to be used in conjunction with this document
    -   Might go into nice to have


## Nice to have Goals


## Non Goals

1.  Describe packages
    -   The intro for packages would be better on the packages homepage
    -   Would make this to verbose
    -   Linking to other descriptions would be better
2.  Rank order packages
3.  Describe why ExoBrain ideas or good. We might link to some but this is a reference document not an intro.
