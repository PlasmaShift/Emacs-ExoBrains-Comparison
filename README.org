#+title: Emacs ExoBrains Comparison

* TODO intro -- I will write this after more of the document is done, besides being easier and at that point I would probably rewrite it anyway
Why do this
There are a lot of programs to become your ExoBrain all designed with differing philosophies and
maybe write this in kotl complex thoughts
** ExoBrain terms . 
ExoBrain -- external brain | Second Brain -- external computer brain "to be used in conjunction with your brian" -- toss this? getting wordy? | GTD -- getting things done | PIM -- Personal information management | PKM -- Personal knowledge management | Zettelkasten -- system of interconncted notes | etc...

* Goals

** Working on
*** TODO Fix this charts remove org enhancements package from charts packages and focus on comparing and contrasting ExoBrain packages
*** TODO Compare packages intelligently. ex Zetteldesk is not a ExoBrain so not in charts. org super links is for ExoBrains so in charts
*** TODO Clean up document
*** TODO Add more packages
*** TODO Fill out package descriptions
*** TODO Add unicode superscripts ยณ in charts and at bottom of charts for additional notes as needed
*** TODO Count talks in EmacsConf 2022 talking about ExoBrains for use in intro. There was a lot of them


** Goals
    1) Give short 2 second descriptions to packages
    2) Compare and contrast packages
       1) This is where "I/we?? choose one" expound on subjects that differentiate between these packages
       2) Talk some about the philosophies and workflows some packagers encourage or were made for


** TODO Maybe Goals | Nice to have Goals -- Choose one
    1) Make multiple MVP "minimum viable product / or bare-bones" emacs configs
       with some demo ExoBrains so you can get a feel for the workflow
       - Might be a separate project but intended to be used in conjunction with this document
       - Might go into nice to have


** Nice to have Goals

** Non Goals
    1) Describe packages
       - The intro for packages would be better on the packages homepage
       - Would make this to verbose
       - Linking to other descriptions would be better
    2) Rank order packages
    3) Describe why ExoBrain ideas or good. We might link to some but this is a reference document not an intro.
